# SeeMore-pre-flight-inspection
Software application destined to recognize 
and classify the wing components as well as
pounding of the AT3-R100 aircraft.

## Brief summary
The following application presents the source code 
according to my Engineering Thesis, which is my last 
examination on the Aviation Engineering curriculum. 
The software is all-purpose tool. Moreover, it can be used 
to recognize and classify any kind of multiclass 
classification task.
## Technologies
The project has been created with the following 
technologies:
* Python: 3.9;
* TensorFlow: 2.6.0;
* Matplotlib: 3.4.3;
* Tkinter: 8.6;
* PIL: 8.4.0.
## Functionality
The following processes can be performed:
* Unzip and clean the files.
* Perform cleaning process of the data images 
(convert all images into the JPEG extension).
* Create subdirectories for the training and
validation data sets (the size of the training data
set can be set manually).
* Configure the generator in order to conduct
data augmentation.
* Compile and fit the hierarchical neural network
model.
* Plot the learning data in the figure.
* Save the trained model.
## Destination
The ultimate goal is to create the software that
would be used during the pre-flight inspection to
identify pounding of the aircraft.
As well as this is to pick up the pace of deep learning
process to solve any multi-classification problem.
## Inspirations
The following project is my own idea in order to
test the application of the artificial intelligence 
methods in the aviation industry. Moreover, the application
introduces my self-taught learning process of the Python language
programming.
